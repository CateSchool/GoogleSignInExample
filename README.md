# GoogleSignInExample

This should help you get Authenticating into Google working. Try it.

You will need to:

 • Put in your Bundle ID (org.cate.cs.YourInitials.GoogleAuth)
 
 • pod install (in the project directory)
 
 • get an OAuth client ID (https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating)
 
 • Add a URL scheme to your project (info / URL-Types)
 
 • Update GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().clientID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with proper OAuth ID.
