# GoogleSignInExample

This should help you get Authenticating into Google working. Try it.

You will need to:
 • pod init (in the project directory)
 • get an OAuth client ID (https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/ios/start-integrating)
 • Add a URL scheme to your project
 • Update GIDSignIn.sharedInstance().clientID = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID" with proper OAuth ID.
